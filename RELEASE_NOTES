            -introduce $(DESC) macro for bsas.db template 
             to avoid a long DESC field issue (overriding $(SECN) in the DESC field)
               

R2.3.0      Aug 9, 2022     Kukhee Kim
            - Support BSA/BSSS/BSAS

R2.2.1-1.0   Aug 9, 2022     Kukhee Kim
             - tested for B84 TPG and AmcCarrierTprTst application

R2.2.0      July 23, 2022
            - PV name change for BSA liniear conversion PVs
              (_OFFSET, _SLOPE) to (__OFFSET_BSA, _SLOPE_BSA) to avoid name conflict with the history module

R2.1.0-5.0         Aug 4, 2022 Kukhee Kim
            - long DESC field issue in another BSSS template
              cherry-pick additional fix from the master branch

R2.1.0-4.0         Aug 2, 2022 Kukhee Kim
            - build against PVXS R0.3.1-0.0.1

R2.1.0-3.0         July 23, 2022  Kukhee Kim
            - expose BSAS command to the symbol table for Cexp shell
            - expose BSSS command to the symbol table for Cexp shell

            (Cherry Picking from master branch - R2.2.0)
            - PV name change for BSA liniear conversion PVs
              (_OFFSET, _SLOPE) to (_OFFSET_BSA, _SLOPE_BSA) to avoid name conflict with the history module
            - introduce new macro $(DESC) for the DESC filed of BSSS scalar PV.
              if $(DESC) is defined, the macro substituion will generate the DESC field with $(DESC) macro,
              if $(DESC) is not defined, the macro subsitition will generate the DESC field with $(SECN) macro - backward compatible
              remark) some of sytem has long $(SECN0 name, it makes trouble to set up the DESC field, we can use a separate macro $(DESC)
                      to avoid generating long DESC with $(SECN)
            - add bsss driver commands to the symbol table for Cexp shell
            (force tagging, Aug 4, 2022)
            - introduce the $(DESC) for bsssChannel control also

            - increase fault buffer length to one million samples
            remark) the bsa length and fault buffer length are set by default values (20000 and 1000000).
            we can change the default values in run-time but not recommended. Please, look at more details in README file

            - put default values
              . slope = 1.
              . offset = 0.
              for the bsa.db template
R0.9.6      April 28, 2017    Kukhee Kim (KHKIM)
            - decouple BSA name (uniqueue key) and BSA PV name

R0.9.5      April 10, 2017    Bruce Hill (bhill)
			Updated for git workflow so we can build bsaDriver for other base versions
			Note: We need to move to new version numbering scheme: major.minor.config
				where major indicates major changes to api and/or features,
				minor indicates minor src changes and/or bug fixes,
				and config indicates no src changes, just build configuration such
				as which version of asyn to build against.

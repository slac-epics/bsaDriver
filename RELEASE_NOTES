R1.4.0      February 7, 2018    Kukhee Kim (KHKIM)
            - rebuild with bsa API R1.0.4 to fix a bug on  fault buffers when wrapped

R1.4.0      January 30, 2018    Kukhee Kim (KHKIM)
            - remove MAXBSALENGTH macro from bsa.db template (default BSA Length is 20000, user doens't need to specify the BSA waveform length)
            - increase fault buffer length to one million samples
            remark) the bsa length and fault buffer length are set by default values (20000 and 1000000).
            we can change the default values in run-time but not recommended. Please, look at more details in README file

              in statistics mode, only "in32" can be supported

R1.2.0-Diag October 3, 2017      Kukhee Kim (KHKIM)
            - add an interface to get AmcCarrierBase class for diagnostic buffer for debugging sequence engine
            - BSA client doesn't use the the interface, it is only for TPG
            - thus, BSA client application doesn't need to update with this version
            - it is test a temporal test version, we are not going to deploy it to production

R1.1.0      September 14, 2017    Kukhee Kim (KHKIM)
            - implement slave BSA node for mulitple independent data conversion
            - the slave BSA shares BSA data source with master, but could have separate
              BSA name and BSA database instances
            - user can set up slope and offset independently for the slave BSA,
              and it allows independent data conversion from the master BSA

            - put default values
              . slope = 1.
              . offset = 0.
              for the bsa.db template
R0.9.6      April 28, 2017    Kukhee Kim (KHKIM)
            - decouple BSA name (uniqueue key) and BSA PV name

R0.9.5      April 10, 2017    Bruce Hill (bhill)
			Updated for git workflow so we can build bsaDriver for other base versions
			Note: We need to move to new version numbering scheme: major.minor.config
				where major indicates major changes to api and/or features,
				minor indicates minor src changes and/or bug fixes,
				and config indicates no src changes, just build configuration such
				as which version of asyn to build against.

#==============================================================

This is an epics driver module to provide BSA, BSSS, BSAS, and BLD interface
for superconducting timing High Performance System (HPS) which is based on ATCA
platform. We are calling BSA, BSSS, BSAS, and BLD as "acquisition services" in
this document.

Important definition:
  - "Signal" is used in this document as a piece of data calculated by the
    system and exported to the acquisition services. Example: X, Y, and TMIT
    are BPM signals. Originally the word "channel" was used with this meaning
    but recently this was changed. The software was all built using the
    "channel" word to define this concept, so you will see IOC shell commands,
    reports, and database record names using "channel" instead of "signal".
    The change in software names will require more time to be implemented.

This module provides:
  - Epics IOC shell commands to configure/setup all the acquisition services.
  - Epics database templates for:
    - BSA and BSSS PVs.
    - Diagnostic PVs for all services.
    - Control PVs for BSSS, BSAS, and BLD.
  - pvxs PVs for BSAS.

***                 2. Basic commands required for st.cmd                   ***
*******************************************************************************

2.1 - yamlLoader Driver:

The yamlLoader driver needs to load up the hierarchy file before BSA
initialization.

Example:
# cpswLoadYamlFile(<top level yaml path>, "NetIODev, "", <carrier board IP)
cpswLoadYamlFile("000TopLevel.yaml", "NetIODev", "", "10.0.3.105")

Please, check up more details in the README file of yamlLoader driver.


2.2 - Load YAML configuration file to disable all acquisition services. A
file template with the YAML contents is available at
README.disable_bld_bsss_bsas.

The line below needs to be added right after cpswLoadYamlFile. Please, adjust
the path for disable_bld_bsss_bsas.yaml accordingly. The second argument, which
is the yaml path may be different from application to application. The one
below should work on most cases. If it doesn't work for you, you need to
contact the firmware engineer to get the correct one.

# Load configuration to disable BSA/BLD/BSSS/BSAS on boot
cpswLoadConfigFile("${YAML_DIR}/config/disable_bld_bsss_bsas.yaml", "mmio/AmcCarrierCore/AmcCarrierBsa")


2.3 Adding BSA names for the driver:

Before starting this configuration, you need to receive from the firmware
engineer the list of BSA signals available, with its data type. Make sure to
have this list in the correct order. When asking the firmware engineer, use the
following jargon: "I need the ordered list of data that goes into the
diagnostic bus, with the data type".
 
bsaDriver provides the ioc shell command 
bsaAdd(<BSA key>, <signal data type>)

You need to use bsaAdd for each of the BSA signals from the list provided by
the firmware engineer, in the same order as the list.

<BSA key> can be any string you want to describe the signal.
<signal data type> can be: "int32", "uint32", "float32". Details on data type
                           restrictions are available later in a specific
                           section of the README.

Optionally, should the signal stay untouched (not scaled using slope/offset or
casted to another type), a third parameter is passed to the bsaAdd function.
This parameter is only used by BLD, not BSA/BSAS/BSSS. More about slope and
offset will be explained later.
    - "0" (or empty) -> Allowed to apply slope/offset
    - "1" -> Do not touch

*Important note!* Although the command is called bsaAdd, the configuration you
make by using it is going to be used by all acquisition services.

The driver also provides the IOC shell command "bsaList()" to print out the BSA
name list, so the IOC engineer can verify the BSA names loaded.

Example of use of the bsaDriver functions:
# ====================================
# Setup BSA Driver
# ====================================
# We need to add the status signals because they are the first ones, even if
# they are not used by the acquisition services.
bsaAdd("STATUSAMC0",       "uint32", 1)
bsaAdd("STATUSAMC1",       "uint32", 1)
# Add signals for BSA, BSSS, BSAS
bsaAdd("TMITAMC0",         "int32")
bsaAdd("TMITAMC1",         "int32")
bsaAdd("XFIXEDPAMC0",      "int32")
bsaAdd("XFIXEDPAMC1",      "int32")
bsaAdd("YFIXEDPAMC0",      "int32")
bsaAdd("YFIXEDPAMC1",      "int32")
# Add signals for BLD
bsaAdd("TMITFLOATAMC0",    "float32", 1)
bsaAdd("TMITFLOATAMC1",    "float32", 1)
bsaAdd("XFLOATPAMC0",      "float32", 1)
bsaAdd("XFLOATPAMC1",      "float32", 1)
bsaAdd("YFLOATPAMC0",      "float32", 1)
bsaAdd("YFLOATPAMC1",      "float32", 1)

        13      YFLOATPAMC1, float32


2.3.1 Adding dependent secondary BSA names for the driver

The secondary BSA node shares BSA data source with the primary. The
secondaries can have different data conversion or separate slope and offset
from the primary BSA. The idea is that you can provide different conversions for
each signal. Example: the signal related to the charge in the BCM could be
presented as coulombs, nano coulombs, or number of electrons.

After creating the primary BSA node using bsaAdd, create the secondary BSA node as
the following:

bsaAddSecondary(<BSA key for primary>, <BSA key for secondary>, <data type>)

- The "BSA key for primary" should exist before adding the secondary
- The "BSA key for secondart" will be used as the BSAKEY database macro for
dbLoadRecords(). More about this will be explained in other README specific
files.

Example:
bsaAddSecondary("TMITAMC0", "TMIT0C0", "int32")
bsaAddSecondary("TMITAMC0", "TMIT0C1", "int32")
bsaAddSecondary("TMITAMC0", "TMIT0C2", "int32")
bsaAddSecondary("TMITAMC0", "TMIT0C3", "int32")
bsaAddSecondary("TMITAMC0", "TMIT0C4", "int32")
bsaAddSecondary("TMITAMC0", "TMIT0C5", "int32")

In this example, we added 6 secondary BSAs for the TMITAMC0 BSA.

bsaList()
  Total 14 BSA(s) has(have) been registered
        0       STATUSAMC0, uint32
        1       STATUSAMC1, uint32
        2       TMITAMC0, int32
                +----- secondary node 0     TMIT0C0, int32
                +----- secondary node 1     TMIT0C1, int32
                +----- secondary node 2     TMIT0C2, int32
                +----- secondary node 3     TMIT0C3, int32
                +----- secondary node 4     TMIT0C4, int32
                +----- secondary node 5     TMIT0C5, int32
        3       TMITAMC1, int32
        4       XFIXEDPAMC0, int32
        5       XFIXEDPAMC1, int32
etc.

bsaList() command shows the primary node and its secondary nodes.


2.3.2 More about signal Data Types

bsaDriver and firmware allow {"int32", "uint32", "float32"} type of data.

Due to limited "space" in the FPGA chip, the firmware will only calculate
statistics (mean and rms) for a BSA signal if its type is int32. This
programming is in the firmware and can't be configured by software. So, if
the firmware engineer sent you the list of BSA signals and a few of them are
float32 you already know that this signal will not have mean and rms calculated
for BSA.

Sometimes the signal will represent a status with each of the bits from a
uint32 representing a condition. Of course a status can't be part of
statistic calculation and this was also already programmed in the firmware.


2.4 Driver initialization

For the driver initialization, bsaDriver provides the IOC shell command
bsaAsynDriverConfigure(<asyn port name for BSA>, <path for register space>, <path for dram space>)

The driver initialization command must be called after completing the yaml
loading by yamlLoader driver (item 2.2) and after the BSA name list is built
(item 2.3).

<asyn port name for BSA> can be any string. This string will be used later to
configure the other acquisition services and also for the BSA EPICS database
template.

The register path and dram path should be consistent with the yaml files. In
the example below, ROOT path of hierarchy is NetIODev. The register space is
located at NetIODev/mmio/AmcCarrierTimingGenerator/AmcCarrierCore/AmcCarrierBsa,
and the stream dram is located at NetIODev/strm/AmcCarrierDRAM/dram.

Example:
bsaAsynDriverConfigure("bsaPort", "mmio/AmcCarrierCore/AmcCarrierBsa","BsaRam/dram")


2.4.1 Check 000TopLevel.yaml if bsaAsynDriverConfigure() fails to load

bldstream needs to be defined in the top yaml file. Although it is called
bldstream, it serves all acquisition services.

# BLD Stream
bldstream: &bldstream
  SRP:
    protocolVersion: SRP_UDP_NONE
  UDP:
    port: 8198
    numRxThreads: *udpThreads
    threadPriority:  *udpPri
    pollSecs: 1

#  Inside NetIoDev session
     bldstream:
       class: Field
       at:
         <<: *bldstream


2.5 Enable/Disable BSA

After the driver initialization, the BSA can be disabled and enabled anytime
via the following commands:

bsaAsynDriverEnable()
bsaAsynDriverDisable()

The bsaAsynDriverConfigure() command (item 2.4) enables BSA by default
(backward compatible).

The enable/disable was introduced for a work around solution for RSSI
communication down issue. We found that RSSI communication was down when 
bsaDriver had a heavy communication load. The communication down caused
exception on iocs.

When the BSA driver is disabled, the firmware still works for BSA and keeps
collecting data internally to the carrier board DRAM. On the other hand, the
software does not check up new data and does not retrieve data from DRAM.

Using bsaAsynDriverDisable is not harmful for the firmware operation. If the
write pointer reach the boundary of the buffer, the pointer moves back to the
start address of the buffer.


2.6 Linear Conversion

Usually the signals arrive from the firmware as an integer number that needs
to be converted to the correct engineering unit.

The BSA database template provides slope and offset PVs for each BSA signal
created by bsaAdd or bsaAddSecondary (bsakey). These PVs affect all acquisition
services at the same time so the signal can be shown with the right unit
everywhere.

The linear conversion affects the following:

  bsa_data       = slope * raw_bsa_data + offset
  bsa_rmsa_value = slope * raw_rms_value

Slope and Offset PV names are:

  $(DEV):$(SECN)_SLOPE_BSA
  $(DEV):$(SECN)_OFFSET_BSA

Macros:
  $(DEV)         ; device PV name
  $(SECN)        ; signal name as part of the PV name

These are in the autosave list. The database template bsa.db has default value
for SLOPE=1 and OFFSET=0. These will be overriden by autosave, once the user
setting is saved.

Example: if the signal name in the PV is TMIT (SECN), consider these default
values for the PVs

  $(DEV):TMIT_SLOPE_BSA = 1
  $(DEV):TMIT_OFFSET_BSA = 0

Suppose that the firmware collected the BSA buffer 27 with 3 values:

  $ caget $(DEV):TMITHST27
  $(DEV):TMITHST27 3 1000 2000 3000

Now let's change slope and offset:

  $(DEV):TMIT_SLOPE_BSA = 0.1
  $(DEV):TMIT_OFFSET_BSA = 32

The new result for the buffer will be:

  $ caget $(DEV):TMITHST27
  $(DEV):TMITHST27 3 132 232 332


2.7 Callback Queue Size

As bsaDriver running all services takes a lot of resources, we need to increase
the size of the queue. Place this command anywhere before iocInit():

callbackSetQueueSize(12000)

To check the status of the acquisition services engine. Although the driver is
called bldStreamDriver, this is the driver that deals with all 4 services: BSA,
BSSS, BSAS, and BLD. Use this command on the IOC shell (if instead of 5 you use
10, some of the counters will be reset):

*******************************************************************************

In normal conducting timing, using the EVG (Event Generator), you would select
the acquisition frequency by using EDEFs (Event Definitions). The correspondent
of it for the superconducting timing TPG (Timing Pattern Generator) is called
the timing filter.

Timing filters are a way of configuring a frequency and applying a few filters
to it, like the destination where the electron bunch is sent to. Timing filters
are used not only by the acquisition services, but also by the configuration of
triggers. So, explaining its configuration is out of scope of this README.

There's a good introductory text on this Confluence page: 
https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/x/4wVwFg. Check for the section related
to timing filters.


*******************************************************************************
***       5. Database macro conventions for all acquisition services        ***
*******************************************************************************

In all available READMEs, when describing EPICS databases, we mention a
DEVICE_PREFIX and a TPR_PREFIX.

By DEVICE_PREFIX we mean the traditional combination of DEVICE:AREA:LOCA.

Some systems may contain multiple DEVICE_PREFIX in the same IOC. Say the MPS
system, for example. Below is a real list of DEVICE_PREFIX for one IOC in
production:

CBLM:UNDH:4575
CBLM:UNDH:4676
BEND:DMPH:395
PBLM:DMO0:846:AH
PBLM:LTUS:846:AH
PBLM:LTUH:846:AH
 
bsaDriver provides a few EPICS database files which generate PVs that are
unique for the entire IOC. In this case the question is inevitable? Which
prefix should I use? CBLM:UNDH:4575? PBLM:DMO0:846:AH?

You see that none of them makes sense. For these cases a new prefix is needed.
One that is unique throughout the IOC. We are calling it TPR_PREFIX.

MPS could use, for example,

TPR:DMO0:MP01:1

***                        6. Severity masks                                ***
*******************************************************************************

Some of the databases provide a way of setting a severity mask. Signals coming
from the firmware are classified according to a severity, similiar to alarm
severities from EPICS. Each severity type has a weight:

None < Minor < Major < Invalid

For all services you can determine that data with a given severity is
discarded. If the severity of the data is less than or equal to the chosen
severity mask, the data is accepted by the acquisition service. Otherwise, it
is thrown away.

In summary, the rule is:

Data accepted if:
    data severity in firmware <= severity mask

Example 1:
Data in firmware is classified as Major.
Severity mask is None.

Major > None ==> data rejected

Example 2:
Data in firmware is classified as Minor.
Severity mask is Invalid.

Minor <= Invalid ==> data accepted

In other words, if Invalid is used for the severity mask, any data will be
accepted.

***  7. Configuration of RT priorities for SLAC protocols and network stack ***
*******************************************************************************

The 000TopLevel.yaml file must appropriately set the real-time priorities for
the SLAC protocols used to communicate with the ATCA board. If the
configuration is not set correctly, the IOC may crash when accessing the
acquisition services.

Check if the yaml file contains this information:
connectionParameters:
  udpPri:     &udpPri      80
  udpThreads: &udpThreads   4
  rssi: &rssiParams   
    retransmissionTimeoutUS: 100000  
    cumulativeAckTimeoutUS:   50000
    threadPriority:             82

Along the entire yaml you should see these configurations for the
threadPriority of UDP and RSSI: 
         UDP:
           port: *udpPortNumber0
           threadPriority: *udpPri
         RSSI:
           <<: *rssiParams
           threadPriority: 81
           inpQueueDepth: 32


The cpu's st.cmd (previously known as "kernel-modules.cmd") must contain correct
thread priorities and buffer size for the kernel network stack. This ensures
that the network will not get stalled when the IOCs start to use a lot of CPU.
Below is what is needed (in this example, eth5 is the interface connected to
the ATCA crate). Each interface connected to the ATCA must have the priority
thread set.

# ==================================================================
# escalating RT priority for network kernel threads (SCHED_FIFO, 84)
# =================================================================                                                                         
for PID in  $(ps -elF | grep eth5 | grep -v grep | awk '{print $4}'); do chrt -f -p 84 $PID ; done
                                                                                                                                            
# ======================================                                                                                                    
# increasing receive buffer size to 10MB                                                                                                    
# ======================================                                                                                                    
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=10485760


Also, for BLD to work properly, jumbo frames need to be configured for each of
the participant network interfaces. This is also configured in the cpu's
st.cmd:

# Add jumbo frames to allow for proper BLD communication
ifconfig eth5 mtu 9000 up
